# Changelog

All notable changes to boatramp are documented here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); the project is pre-1.0, so the API
(HTTP, CLI, config, and the published library crates) may change between minor
versions.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- **Function-to-function invoke for site handlers (mesh orchestrator).** A site
  handler (a `routing.handlers` route) reached over HTTP with the end user's bearer
  can now call sibling functions **in-process** via the `invoke` capability, exactly
  like a top-level function. `HandlerConfig` gains `invoke_targets` (the same
  deny-by-default, `*`-wildcard allowlist as `FunctionConfig.invoke_targets`), and
  `invoke` is a recognized handler import — gated by the site's `allow_imports`, the
  handler's `imports`, and a non-empty `invoke_targets`. The callee is quota-admitted
  and depth-capped as on the top-level path, and the caller's `Authorization` is
  forwarded to the callee unchanged.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (compute): the root-filesystem source is a typed `RootSource`.**
  `ComputeSpec.rootfs` was one overloaded string that meant a different thing per
  backend — an OCI image reference (docker/cloudflare), a tar rootfs archive (native
  container), or a rootfs filesystem image (firecracker micro-VM). It is now
  `root: RootSource { Image | Tar | Rootfs }`, one variant per artifact form, matched
  1:1 to the backends that accept it (a mismatch is a typed error, not a silent
  runtime failure). `boatramp compute set` now takes exactly one of `--image`,
  `--tar`, or `--rootfs` (previously a file-only `--rootfs` that could not carry an
  image reference and hard-coded ext4).
  **Migration:** re-declare compute workloads with the source flag that matches the
  target substrate — `--image <ref>` for docker/cloudflare, `--tar <artifact>` for the
  native container runtime, `--rootfs <artifact>` for the micro-VM. Stored
  `ComputeSpec` JSON changes shape (`"rootfs": "…"` → `"root": {"image"|"tar"|"rootfs": "…"}`).

## [0.1.2]

### Changed
- **BREAKING (external SQL): one placeholder syntax everywhere.** The handler
  `sql` binding's contract is now **numbered `?N` placeholders** (`?1`, `?2`, …)
  on *every* backend. The external Postgres/MySQL backends previously passed
  statements through to the driver, so they required the engine's *native* syntax
  (Postgres `$1`, MySQL `?`); they now take the same `?N` as the managed libsql
  default and the host rewrites to the native form. Statements are validated
  fail-closed — native `$N`, bare `?`, `:name`/`@name`, out-of-range indices, and
  placeholder/parameter miscounts are **rejected** rather than silently bound to
  the wrong value (closing a cross-tenant wrong-parameter hazard at the `sql`
  scoping boundary).
  **Migration:** in guest SQL that targets an external Postgres/MySQL database,
  change native placeholders to `?N` (mechanical: `$1`→`?1`; a bare `?` →
  `?1`/`?2`/… in order). Casts move onto the placeholder: `$1::int` → `?1::int`.
  SQL against the managed libsql default is unaffected. Adds a `sqlparser`
  dependency (dialect-aware tokenizer) behind the `sql*` features.

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- **Function-to-function invoke.** A function can call a sibling **in-process** via
  the new `invoke` capability (a `boatramp:handlers/invoke` WIT interface), instead
  of a network round-trip. Calls are gated by a per-function wildcard target
  allowlist (`invoke_targets`), capped at a maximum call depth to stop invocation
  loops, and the callee is quota-admitted and metered exactly like an external
  invoke. New `examples/handlers/invoke-caller` guest and a `just build-fixtures`
  recipe to rebuild the example test fixtures.

### Changed
- **crates.io metadata.** Every published crate now carries the project README,
  `homepage`/`documentation` (https://boatramp.dev), `keywords`, and `categories`,
  and the package authors are set to Uranion — so the crate pages are complete.
- Updated the vendored `spin` lockfile entries off the yanked 0.9.8/0.10.0.

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/BoatRamp/BoatRamp/releases/tag/v0.1.1

## [0.1.0]

The first public release: boatramp is a self-hosted, streaming-first alternative to
Vercel — one binary that is both the server and the CLI.

### Publishing & serving
- Atomic, immutable, content-addressed deployments with instant rollback, named
  aliases (staging/previews), and virtualhost routing.
- Custom domains with ownership verification (HTTP + DNS-01), automatic TLS
  (ACME, ACME-DNS wildcard, operator certs, and a pinned raw-public-key control
  channel), and managed DNS across many providers.
- Visitor access control (basic auth, IP rules, rate limiting), caching, and
  optional on-the-fly compression.

### Compute
- WebAssembly handlers and functions: sync/async/scheduled invocation, metering and
  quotas, signed webhooks, queue/blob-change triggers, and declarative workflows;
  bindings for kv, sql, blobstore, and messaging; Rust/JS/Python developer flows.
- Containers and Firecracker microVMs (an embedded rust-vmm VMM), scale-to-zero, and
  a reverse-proxy gateway with health-checked load balancing.

### Storage
- Blob backends: filesystem, S3, GCS, Azure (with their change-notification
  providers). KV backends: SlateDB, in-memory, Cloudflare KV. External bring-your-own
  PostgreSQL/MySQL for the `sql` binding.

### Control plane & security
- COSE/CWT tokens with Cedar RBAC, per-request DPoP proof-of-possession, offline
  delegation, external signers (KMS/HSM/Vault/PKCS#11), and OIDC.
- A curated security-posture model and hardened defaults.

### Fleet
- A self-hosted Raft cluster with dynamic join over a raw-public-key mutual-TLS mesh,
  an in-binary Kubernetes operator, and a Cloudflare Containers deployment target.
- Dynamic daemon configuration (no-restart operational knobs) and Prometheus metrics.

### Interfaces
- An embedded web management console.
- A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to drive one or more instances from an AI
  agent, over stdio or an HTTP `/mcp` endpoint.
