# Run boatramp on Kubernetes

boatramp ships a **Kubernetes operator in the same binary** — there is no separate
controller image or Helm chart to track. The operator reconciles a
`BoatRampCluster` custom resource into its workloads (a StatefulSet for cluster
mode, or a Deployment + HPA for a stateless frontend) and drives the Raft
membership as pods come and go, using the same [dynamic-join](./deploy-cluster.md)
model as the CLI — the ordinal-0 pod founds, the rest join with a ticket.

## Install the operator

The operator ships as a **Helm chart** (`charts/boatramp-operator`) — CRDs, a
least-privilege `ClusterRole`, and the operator Deployment:

```sh
helm install boatramp-operator ./charts/boatramp-operator \
  --namespace boatramp-system --create-namespace
```

Or, without Helm, apply the same bundle emitted by the binary itself:

```sh
boatramp operator manifests | kubectl apply -f -
```

`boatramp operator crds` prints just the CRDs (the chart's `crds/` are generated
from these — a CI check guards against drift); `boatramp operator run` is the
controller entrypoint (what the Deployment runs). The operator watches
`BoatRampCluster` and the tenant `Site` CRD (and `Function`, once the FaaS backend
lands) and reconciles them via server-side apply, so it owns exactly the fields it
sets. Release images are cosign-signed with an attached CycloneDX SBOM.

## Create a cluster

Provision the cluster's keys as Secrets, then declare the cluster. The pods need
the root **private** key to sign join tokens/attestations (`authSecret`); the
operator needs an **admin token** to drive membership (`adminTokenSecret`):

```sh
# The auth Secret wired into the pods: the root private key (the founder signs
# with it) + a single-use bootstrap secret (to mint the first admin token).
kubectl create secret generic prod-auth \
  --from-literal=root-private-key="$BOATRAMP_AUTH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  --from-literal=bootstrap-secret="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"

# The admin token the operator uses for /api/cluster/* — mint it against the
# founded cluster with the bootstrap secret (`token bootstrap`), then store it:
kubectl create secret generic prod-admin --from-literal=token="$ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: boatramp.dev/v1alpha1
kind: BoatRampCluster
metadata:
  name: prod
spec:
  mode: cluster                 # or `stateless` (Deployment + HPA)
  replicas: 3
  storage: 10Gi                 # per-node Raft PVC (cluster mode)
  posture: multi-tenant         # the operator enforces this floor
  rootPubkey: "es256:03a1…"     # the cluster root anchor (auth pubkey)
  authSecret: prod-auth         # Secret: root-private-key (+ bootstrap-secret)
  adminTokenSecret: prod-admin  # Secret with an admin `token` key
```

The operator renders a `[cluster]` config into the pods (so `serve` runs the
embedded Raft node), wires the root private key + bootstrap secret from
`authSecret`, exposes the mesh port on the headless Service, and gives each pod
its own dialable advertise address via the downward API — so the founder can sign
and joiners can be reached. The control plane must run `--tls rpk` for the
attestation-pinned join; wiring that end-to-end in the operator is in progress.

The reconciler:

1. Applies the StatefulSet (+ headless Service, per-node PVC, PDB), a client
   Service, and a ConfigMap.
2. Designates **pod-0 as the founder** — the pod reads its own name from the
   downward API (`BOATRAMP_POD_NAME`); ordinal 0 founds, every other ordinal
   joins. (The node *identity* is still derived from each pod's mesh key.)
3. As pods become ready, drives one **quorum-safe** membership transition per
   reconcile against the cluster API: add the joining pod as a learner (by
   rolling a fresh single-use join ticket into the `<name>-join` Secret the pods
   read as `BOATRAMP_CLUSTER_JOIN`), promote a caught-up learner to a voter, or —
   on scale-down — remove an out-of-range member *before* its pod is deleted. It
   never acts without quorum and never removes the last voter.

Without `adminTokenSecret`/`rootPubkey` the operator still reconciles the
workloads and **plans + reports** membership, but does not execute it.

## Observe

```sh
kubectl get boatrampcluster            # PHASE + QUORUM print-columns
kubectl describe brc prod              # .status.members + observedGeneration
```

`boatramp cluster status --server <client-service-url>` gives the same
address-primary membership view the CLI shows for a bare-metal cluster (the pod
address is the handle for `cluster remove`).

## Declare sites with GitOps

A `Site` custom resource is reconciled into a boatramp site on its cluster's
control plane — declare hostnames in Git, `kubectl apply`, and a **finalizer**
cleans up the routing on `kubectl delete`:

```yaml
apiVersion: boatramp.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Site
metadata:
  name: marketing
spec:
  cluster: prod            # omit ⇒ the sole cluster in the namespace
  domains:
    - example.com          # → primary
    - www.example.com      # → alias
    - "*.preview.example.com"  # → wildcard
```

The operator resolves the target `BoatRampCluster`, uses its `adminTokenSecret`
to `PUT` the site config, and reports `.status.phase`. (`kubectl get site` shows
it.) Publishing content to the site is still a `boatramp sync` / CI deploy — the
`Site` CR governs its identity + domains, not its deployments.

> **`Function` (FaaS):** the `Function` CRD is installed and watched, but its
> apply path awaits the FaaS backend (`PLAN-faas`); today it reports a `Pending`
> status. Don't rely on it to deploy a component yet.

## Scaling

Change `spec.replicas` and re-apply. The operator converges one member at a time:
scale-up adds learners then promotes them; scale-down removes the highest
ordinals first, always quorum-safe. Kill a pod and the StatefulSet recreates it;
it rejoins (or resumes from its PVC) with no manual step.

A node's **PVC is retained** on scale-down and on StatefulSet delete
(`persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy: Retain`) — a Raft voter's durable
log/state is never auto-reclaimed. Removing the data is an explicit operator step.

## Rolling upgrades

Bump `spec.image` and re-apply. The operator drives a **quorum-aware** rolling
upgrade: it pauses the StatefulSet rollout (via the `RollingUpdate` partition)
whenever the cluster lacks a spare ready voter, so an upgrade never drops the
cluster below quorum. Combined with the PodDisruptionBudget, a node drain behaves
the same way. When a voter's pod does restart, Raft re-elects a new leader
automatically (a sub-second election); explicit leader-transfer to avoid that brief
write pause is a future optimization (openraft 0.9 has no simple transfer call).
